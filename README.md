## bradeythedev's dlang libraries - Simple yet useful libraries for the D programming language

### Welcome
The following are simple libraries to include in your Dlang project - feel free, they are open source :)
Some may have alternatives, some of which might even be in the standard library, but I'm so lazy I would rather rewrite them myself than figure out how to use the existing ones.
Below is a list of the libraries...

- ### bdl.fromString
    To install ```bdl.fromString```, you can clone the entire repo, download the file individually, or download it from the releases tab.

- ### bdl.bdlTerm
    To install ```bdl.bdlTerm```, you can clone the entire repo, download the file individually, or download it from the releases tab.
    - #### bdl.bdlTerm.bdlTermQuery
        To install ```bdl.fromTermQuery```, you can clone the entire repo, download the file individually, or download it from the releases tab.
